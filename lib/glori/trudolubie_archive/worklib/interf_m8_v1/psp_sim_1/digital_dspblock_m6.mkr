The specified pin is an isolated pin. This might cause topological

INFORMATION: Connection of a pin can be established in either of the following ways:
1. Connect it through a wire to another signal/pin.
2. Attach FLOAT property with value 'e', 'r', 'n' or 'u' to specify:
   'e' : looks for 'Net_Name' property for the name of net to be connected to this pin.
   'r' : attached a large resistor (1/GMIN) to the pin and grounds the resistor. Note
	   however that this net will need to be connected to another pin/signal for
	   simulation to proceed correctly.
   'n' : generates a unique net name, and attaches it to the pin.
   'u' : if this pin should not be modeled in the netlist.

INFORMATION: Connection of a pin can be established in either of the following ways:
1. Connect it through a wire to another signal/pin.
2. Attach FLOAT property with value 'e', 'r', 'n' or 'u' to specify:
   'e' : looks for 'Net_Name' property for the name of net to be connected to this pin.
   'r' : attached a large resistor (1/GMIN) to the pin and grounds the resistor. Note
	   however that this net will need to be connected to another pin/signal for
	   simulation to proceed correctly.
   'n' : generates a unique net name, and attaches it to the pin.
   'u' : if this pin should not be modeled in the netlist.

INFORMATION: Connection of a pin can be established in either of the following ways:
1. Connect it through a wire to another signal/pin.
2. Attach FLOAT property with value 'e', 'r', 'n' or 'u' to specify:
   'e' : looks for 'Net_Name' property for the name of net to be connected to this pin.
   'r' : attached a large resistor (1/GMIN) to the pin and grounds the resistor. Note
	   however that this net will need to be connected to another pin/signal for
	   simulation to proceed correctly.
   'n' : generates a unique net name, and attaches it to the pin.
   'u' : if this pin should not be modeled in the netlist.

2. Attach FLOAT property with value 'e', 'r', 'n' or 'u' to specify:
   'e' : looks for 'Net_Name' property for the name of net to be connected to this pin.
   'r' : attached a large resistor (1/GMIN) to the pin and grounds the resistor. Note
	   however that this net will need to be connected to another pin/signal for
	   simulation to proceed correctly.
   'n' : generates a unique net name, and attaches it to the pin.

2. Attach FLOAT property with value 'e', 'r', 'n' or 'u' to specify:
   'e' : looks for 'Net_Name' property for the name of net to be connected to this pin.
   'r' : attached a large resistor (1/GMIN) to the pin and grounds the resistor. Note
	   however that this net will need to be connected to another pin/signal for
	   simulation to proceed correctly.
   'n' : generates a unique net name, and attaches it to the pin.
